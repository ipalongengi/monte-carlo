# Monte Carlo Method and Normal Distribution
The purpose of this project is to write a program that *generates* __and__ *stores* many normally distributed
random numbers in an `ArrayList`, organize them in a visually useful way, 
and performs simple operations on them to test their validity.

## Background
This project was assigned as the second individual project for Software Design Lab class
from Fall 2015 with Professor Bhisham Bherwani. The project already has the list of 
methods that need to be written for each class and their descriptions.
In the case of `Histogram` class, the professor has provided a template to work from.

## Project Structure 
This project consists of writing four classes:
- `MonteCarlo` class that contains the `Main()` method
- `Simulation` class that contains seven methods for creating the simulation
- `Metrics` class of one `static` method to check the correctness of the simulation
- `Histogram` that contains seven methods to create visual representation of the simulation
